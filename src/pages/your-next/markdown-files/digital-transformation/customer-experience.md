description: In the digital economy,  customer experience has become the new competitive edge. Businesses that adopt a customer centric approach are more successful than their peers. Great CX requires a customer first approach, whether it is navigating your website, providing good customer services or product experience. CX is a measure of every interaction a customer has with your business and is an inescapable criterion of digital transformation. At the crux of this transformation is the use of technology. Organizations that can leverage technology can deliver much better customer experience and align strategy versus execution. This alignment is often seen as the most critical element to create balance and a differentiating customer experience. Different Industries, Manufacturing, Retail, Automobile, Finance & Media use digitally enabled processes across their supply chain to transform the customer experience at every touch point. On the good side, there are no options when it comes to CX.
