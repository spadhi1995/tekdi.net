Marketplaces are becoming increasingly vital when it comes to customer search.  The biggest impact of Digital Transformation has been on Marketplaces & ecommerce. Digital has enabled the buyers and the sellers to meet on e-commerce platforms and Marketplaces giving both the buyers and the sellers plenty of options to interact with each other. Choice and Fulfillment are top drivers that are pushing these ecosystems to evolve more rapidly than ever.  

The fact that both the B2C as well as B2B Markets are increasingly adopting to Marketplaces is a sign that both the buyers and the sellers need a thorough access to a common place where not only they could transact but also a platform where they get instant feedback, reviews and product experience. Gratification and sentiments are driving this behavior further and  the fact that more than 50% of user search is estimated to happen outside of search engines is a signal that the future of sellers is on eCommerce platforms. 

Marketplaces for B2B Businesses create an ecosystem for different Products to integrate with each other using API’s and Connectors. This further simplifies the way Business happens in the new world because every product or service is now available on the edge of cloud.
