description: Encouraging healthy competition in peers can do wonders for performance and output. When people see that doing just a little extra can make them go to the top of a leaderboard, it pushes them to give their best. Our gamification platform lets you create competitions and leaderboards not just at the workplace but even for sports and social events. The SaaS platform allows organisations to sign up, create competitions, points earning rules and displays a leaderboard. Both individual and team competitions are supported. APIs are available for integrating with external systems.
